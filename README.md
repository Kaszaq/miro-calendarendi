# Plugin for Miro - Calendarendi

This plugin allows to create calendars which update themselves each day. Each day the previously active day style is copied applied onto a current date box. 
Previous days have style applied the same as day before previously active day. Because of that behaviour this allows for some cool use cases!

## Use cases
There are multiple use cases for use of this plugin. Short showcase can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSJQVUzjopQ&feature=youtu.be

#### Just as normal calendar where you can for instance put your notes on with team members holdays

#### Mark current date on some timeline

#### Mark progress or incoming doom

#### Highlight day of the week in some table

#### Highlight week

#### Highlight month

## Why

* to easily create a calendar on which we could add cross team notes, like who is on holidays/conference so it would be easily visible next to our kanban board
* to see nicely what is the current date on our project timelines

## Known issues & upcoming features
* currently draws only 3 month forward and one previous, would be better to have this selected by the user
* which timezone is this actually? Code should handle this for instance by setting the timezone in metadata
* would be nice if users could test functionality of changing days somehow using modal on bottom? Otherwise then can only assume, but maybe that is sufficient?
* when a board is opened and day changes it should also update the board date. Currently it is not and date update is triggered only during board open.
